<h1 id="top">Using Behavioral-Responses</h1>

<p>This document tells you how to use Behavioral-Responses, an
open-source model in the Policy Simulation Library (PSL) collection of
USA tax models.  You always use Behavioral-Responses in conjunction with
<a href="https://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/">
Tax-Calculator</a>, the static-analysis model in the PSL collection of
USA tax models, by writing and executing a Python script.  For an
introduction to writing Python scripts using Tax-Calculator, read the
tested recipes in our
<a href="https://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/cookbook.html">
Tax-Calculator Cookbook</a>.  If you want to participate in the
development of Behavioral-Responses &mdash; by asking a question,
reporting a bug, improving the documentation or making an enhancement
to the Python source code &mdash; you should go to
the <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Behavioral-Responses">
developer website</a>.</p>

<p>Please cite the source of your analysis as <q>Behavioral-Responses
release #.#.#, author's calculations.</q> If you wish to link to
Behavioral-Responses, this page is preferred.  Additionally, we strongly
recommend that you describe the input data used, and provide a link to
the materials required to replicate your analysis or, at least, note
that those materials are available upon request.</p>

<h2 id="paramlogic">Response Parameters and Logic</h2>

<p>The Behavioral-Responses parameters and logic are described in the
<a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Behavioral-Responses/blob/master/behresp/behavior.py">
behavior.py</a> file, where the parameters are defined in the
<kbd>PARAM_INFO</kbd> dictionary, and the logic of how those parameters
are used along with Tax-Calculator results is defined in the
<kbd>response</kbd> function.</p>

<p>An interface to Behavioral-Responses for the
<a href="https://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/">TaxBrain web application</a>
is located in the
<a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Behavioral-Responses/blob/master/behresp/tbi.py">
tbi.py</a> file.  But this is of interest only to TaxBrain developers.</p>

<h2 id="pyrecipe">Basic Python Recipe</h2>

<p>A tested recipe for using the Behavioral-Responses parameters and
<kbd>response</kbd> function is contained in recipe 2 of the
<a href="https://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/cookbook.html">
Tax-Calculator Cookbook</a> and in the <kbd>test_response_function</kbd> in the
<a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Behavioral-Responses/blob/master/behresp/tests/test_behavior.py">
test_behavior.py</a> file.</p>

<p>Notice that when writing a script like this you must import both
the <kbd>taxcalc</kbd> package (to access Tax-Calculator) and
the <kbd>behresp</kbd> package (to access Behavioral-Responses).  Both
these conda packages can be installed on your computer using this
command at the operating-system command prompt:
<pre>
  conda install -c PSLmodels behresp
</pre>
Or, if you already have both of the packages installed but want to
upgrade them to the most recent versions, use these commands at the
operating-system command prompt:
<pre>
  conda update -c PSLmodels taxcalc
  conda update -c PSLmodels behresp
</pre>
</p>

<p>The Behavioral-Responses logic assumes that the parameters apply to
all filing units.  If you want to estimate responses where the value
of the parameters vary across (say, earnings) groups, you can use the
Tax-Calculator <kbd>quantity_response</kbd> function.  A recipe for
doing this is contained in the
<a href="https://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/cookbook.html">
Tax-Calculator Cookbook</a>.  That recipe simply estimates the
responses.  But the techniques used in the Behavioral-Responses
<kbd>response</kbd> function can be used to apply the estimated
responses to the post-reform Tax-Calculator object and recompute
tax liabilities, producing tax liability estimates that include the
partial-equilibrium effects of the estimated behavioral responses.
